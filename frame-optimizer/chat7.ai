## SYSTEM:

You are a helpful assistant. Be brief, you're talking to an expert.

When you're writing code:
* If you write Python, use mypy annotations. Use modern syntax, like list[str] instead of List[str] and str | int instead of Union.
* Make the code readable -- break things into functions that are debuggable and can be easily unit tested.
* Don't overuse comments, no need to comment every line. Only comment things that are not obvious from reading the code.
* Don't output entire code listings unless I explicitly ask for it. Full code listings are hard to parse if I'm just interested in a single change.

Fractal2DDiff.forward(depth, temperature=0.0001) (note the very low temperature, which should produce hard boundaries!) and Fractal2DNonDiff.forward(depth)  produces slightly different images, where the differences get more pronounced the higher the max_depth. I've converted a Fractal2DNonDiff to diff using model.to_diff(). Could it have to do with the < comparison in x_positions[horizontal_mask] < split_x[horizontal_mask], which may cause rounding differences compared to the diff version?

In Fractal2DNonDiff, could you try making the split point logic more similar to the diff version?

## ASSISTANT:

You're right that the difference between the two implementations might be related to how the splits are performed. Let's modify the Fractal2DNonDiff to make its split logic more similar to the differentiable version.

In the differentiable version, the splits use sigmoid to create a smooth transition, while the non-differentiable version uses a hard comparison. Even with a very low temperature, there might be slight numerical differences. Let's update the Fractal2DNonDiff forward method to make it closer to the differentiable implementation:

```python
def forward(self, max_depth: int) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Parallel implementation of fractal generation using GPU
    """
    batch_size = self.num_points_x * self.num_points_y

    # Initialize with all pixels assigned to the root node (index 0)
    current_indices = torch.zeros(batch_size, dtype=torch.long, device=self.device)

    # Use pre-computed grid points
    x_positions = self.grid_points[:, 0]
    y_positions = self.grid_points[:, 1]

    # Process all depths in sequence, but process all pixels in parallel
    for depth in range(max_depth):
        # Get split parameters for current nodes
        curr_directions = self.split_directions[current_indices]
        curr_split_points = self.split_points[current_indices]

        # Determine which side of the split each pixel falls on
        # For horizontal splits (direction=0): compare x position to split
        h_is_left = x_positions < curr_split_points

        # For vertical splits (direction=1): compare y position to split
        v_is_left = y_positions < curr_split_points

        # Blend based on direction (0=horizontal, 1=vertical)
        is_left = torch.where(curr_directions == 0, h_is_left, v_is_left)

        # Determine child indices based on which side of the split
        left_children = self.left_child_indices[current_indices]
        right_children = self.right_child_indices[current_indices]

        # Update current indices based on which side of the split
        current_indices = torch.where(is_left, left_children, right_children)

    # After processing all depths, map to final class values
    final_classes = self.classes[current_indices]

    # Reshape back to grid
    return final_classes.reshape(self.num_points_x, self.num_points_y)
```

This modified implementation removes the bounding box updates and makes the split comparison directly with the original grid coordinates, which is more aligned with how the differentiable version works. The key differences:

1. The original non-differentiable version calculated split positions based on normalized coordinates within the current bounding box.
2. The new implementation uses the direct comparison of grid coordinates with split points, similar to the differentiable version.

This should make the two implementations more consistent. The remaining difference is that the differentiable version uses sigmoid for smooth transitions, while this still uses hard comparisons, but with a very low temperature in the differentiable version, this difference should be minimal.
